# React Native Course Project

A `Course Goals` App which is simply a TextInput with a button that you use to Enter `Course Goals` (pieces of random text basically) and Save them inside the App root component state and render a List that displays all the entered goals.

## to run this application (i don't know why you would need to do it) just run `npm start` inside the project directory
